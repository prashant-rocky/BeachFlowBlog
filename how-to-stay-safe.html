    <h1 class="beach-title">How to Stay Safe While Enjoying the Beach</h1>

    <p class="beach-intro">
      Spending time at the beach is refreshing, fun, and relaxing—but safety should always come first. From
      changing tides to strong sunlight, the beach environment can be unpredictable. A few simple precautions can
      make your visit smoother and more enjoyable, allowing you to focus on the beauty of the ocean without
      unnecessary risks. This guide will help you stay safe while making the most of your beach experience.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h2 class="beach-heading">Check Weather and Tide Conditions</h2>
    <p class="beach-text">
      Before heading out, always check weather updates and tide schedules. Sudden storms, high winds, or strong
      waves can make swimming dangerous. Apps and local forecasts provide accurate information to help you plan
      better. Knowing whether the tide is rising or falling can also prevent unexpected situations, especially if
      you're walking near rocks or exploring tide pools.
    </p>

    <h2 class="beach-heading">Swim Only in Designated Safe Areas</h2>
    <p class="beach-text">
      Beaches usually mark safe swimming zones with signs, flags, or ropes. These areas are monitored by
      lifeguards and are usually free from strong currents. Avoid swimming in unfamiliar or isolated spots where
      help may not be nearby. If you’re unsure about conditions, never hesitate to ask a lifeguard—they have
      expert knowledge of the beach’s daily changes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="beach-heading">Follow Lifeguard Instructions</h2>
    <p class="beach-text">
      Lifeguards are trained to keep visitors safe, so always listen to their instructions and warnings. If they
      signal you to stay out of the water or move to a safer area, follow their guidance immediately. Their advice
      is based on live observations of currents, wind patterns, and potential hazards that may not be visible from
      the shore.
    </p>

    <h2 class="beach-heading">Protect Yourself From the Sun</h2>
    <p class="beach-text">
      Sun exposure can be strong at the beach due to reflection from the sand and water. Apply sunscreen with
      adequate SPF, reapply every few hours, and wear a hat or sunglasses for extra protection. Taking breaks
      under an umbrella or shade helps prevent sunburns and heat-related issues, especially during peak afternoon
      hours.
    </p>

    <h2 class="beach-heading">Stay Hydrated and Take Regular Breaks</h2>
    <p class="beach-text">
      Spending long hours in the sun can make you feel tired or dehydrated. Carry plenty of drinking water and sip
      regularly, even if you don’t feel thirsty. Enjoy short breaks to rest, cool down, and regain energy before
      returning to swimming or other activities.
    </p>

    <h2 class="beach-heading">Be Cautious of Waves and Currents</h2>
    <p class="beach-text">
      The ocean can be unpredictable. Rip currents, sudden strong waves, or steep drop-offs can catch even
      experienced swimmers off guard. If you’re caught in a rip current, try to stay calm and swim parallel to the
      shore until you’re free from the pull. Never fight against the current directly—it only exhausts you faster.
    </p>

    <h2 class="beach-heading">Keep an Eye on Your Belongings</h2>
    <p class="beach-text">
      A crowded beach can make it easy to misplace your items. Keep your valuables minimal and secure them in a
      safe spot, preferably in a waterproof bag. If you’re traveling with friends or family, take turns watching
      belongings while others enjoy the water.
    </p>

    <h2 class="beach-heading">Respect Marine Life</h2>
    <p class="beach-text">
      Many beaches are home to diverse sea creatures. Avoid touching jellyfish, crabs, or unfamiliar objects in
      the water. Even harmless-looking creatures can cause stings or irritation. Admire marine life from a
      distance and avoid stepping on fragile habitats like coral or seaweed beds.
    </p>

    <h2 class="beach-heading">Make Safety a Habit</h2>
    <p class="beach-text">
      Staying safe at the beach doesn’t require much effort—just awareness and common sense. By checking
      conditions, understanding your surroundings, and taking preventive measures, you can enjoy a fun, peaceful,
      and worry-free beach day. With the right habits, every trip to the ocean becomes a positive memory worth
      repeating.
